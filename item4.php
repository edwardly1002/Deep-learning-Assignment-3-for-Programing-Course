	<h2>Self-driving cars</h2>
	<br>
	<p>Every year, traffic accidents account for 2.2% of global deaths. That stacks up to roughly 1.3 million a year — 3,287 a day. On top of this, 
	some 20–50 million people are seriously injured in auto-related accidents each year. The root of these accidents? Human error. From distracted 
	driving to drunk driving to reckless driving to careless driving, one poor or inattentive decision could be the difference between a typical 
	drive and a life-threatening situation. But what if we could neutralize human error from the equation? Therefore, automatic vehicles are necessary.</p>

	<h4>What component using Deep Learning?</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Street sign detection</li>
		<li>Decision making in steering or driving straight forward</li>
		<li>Obstacle detection and collision anticipation in order to carry out safe decision</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Robots</h2>
	<br>
	<p>Robots are the big chunk of what fantasies we imagine in the future of technology. 1984, the great movie Terminator was released, depicting a 
	world in which human-like robots have taken control. No technology at the time was near the ones showcased in this science-fiction, but somehow, 
	the idea that anthropomorphous machines will be a common thing never seemed very far.</p>

	<br>
	<h4>An achievement: Sophia</h4>
	<p>19th of April, 2015, the puppet was switched on for the first time. The same puppet that received Saudi citizenship, late 2017. Numerous stories about 
	it have been written and shared all around the world. It gave speeches, attended tv shows, answered countless interviews… There is very little chance you 
	haven’t heard of Sophia.</p>

	<br>
		<div class="container-fluid" style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/sophia.png" style="width:65%"/></div>
	<br>

	<p>Sophia is presented to us as the achievement of mankind that finally links us to the future we dreamed of and saw in the movies. Saudi Arabia even gave 
	it an official citizenship, making it a legal entity, equivalent to a human being. It make us glad since big progress seems to be happening. Besides, people 
	turn out to be afraid of when things seem to move so quickly. Medias using the classical rational approach in response, trying to predict how and when robots 
	will take over humanity. Should we start giving robots different rights? Does Sophia have feelings?. Do robots have feeling?</p>

	<p>In conclusion, thanks to deep learning and other physical advancement, Sophia can reach high level of communicating and thinking. In the future, when 
	learning becomes "deeper", it is no doubt that our AI dream can be achieved.</p>
