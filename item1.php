	<h4>What is Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)?</h4>
	<p>Speech is the primary mode of communication among human beings. On the other hand, prevalent means of input to computers is 
	through a keyboard or a mouse. It would be nice if computers could listen to human speech and carry out their commands. Automatic 
	Speech Recognition (ASR) is the process of deriving the transcription (word sequence) of an utterance, given the speech waveform. 
	Speech understanding goes one step further, and gleans the meaning of the utterance in order to carry out the speakerâ€™s command. </p>
	<br>

	<h4>There are many ways to apply ASR to daily life</h4>
	<p>ASR systems facilitate a physically handicapped person to command and control a machine. Even
	ordinary persons would prefer a voice interface over a keyboard or mouse. The advantage is more obvious
	in case of small hand held devices. Dictation machine is a well known application of ASR. Thanks to
	the ubiquitous telecommunication systems, speech interface is very convenient for data entry, access of
	information from remote databases, interactive services such as ticket reservation. ASR systems are
	expedient in cases where hands and eyes are busy such as driving or surgery. They are useful for teaching
	phonetic and programmed teaching as well.</p>

	<h4>The world's ASR status</h4>
	<p>There are several Dictation Systems of very large (over 100,000) vocabulary with recognition accuracy of
	about 97%; these are speaker dependent and needs to be trained. Automatic Call Routing systems based
	on ASR technology have been in use for more than a decade. A few airlines employ speech recognition
	systems to provide information to callers and even permit booking of airline ticket. An ASR system
	recognises and understands quries in fluently spoken German, and provides train timetable information. 
	Other example ASR applications are automated switchboard of a large German company, the movie
	or football information system.</p>
	<br>

	<h4>Conclusion</h4>
	<p>Significant progress has been made in the past couple of decades in the area of spoken language technology.
	This has led to deployment of speech recognition systems in a few application domains. Yet, the current
	engineering models of speech and language do not adequately model the natural language capabilities of
	human brain. The cognitive aspects of human brain are complex and development of appropriate models
	is still a challenging research task. Such a development will lead to Ubiquitous Speech Communication
	Interfaces through which people will be able to interact with machines as conveniently and naturally as
	do amongst themselves.
