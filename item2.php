	<h4>What is Image Recognition</h4>
	<p>Image recognition refers to technologies that identify places, logos, people, objects, buildings, and several other variables in images. 
	Image recognition is a part of computer vision and a process to identify and detect an object or attribute in a digital video or image. Computer 
	vision is a broader term which includes methods of gathering, processing and analyzing data from the real world. The data is high-dimensional and 
	produces numerical or symbolic information in the form of decisions. Apart from image recognition, computer vision also includes event detection, object 
	recognition, learning, image reconstruction and video tracking.</p>

	<h4>Which field can we apply Image Recognition?</h4>
	<p><strong>E-commerce industry: </strong>The level of adoption of this technology is the highest in e-commerce including search and advertising. 
	Image recognition can transform your smartphone into a virtual showroom. It is used in mobile applications to identify specific products. It presents 
	a more interactive view of the world by making everything they see searchable.</p>
	<p><strong>Gaming Industry: </strong>The world of gaming will be revolutionized by image recognition and computer vision technology. In fact, this 
	revolution is already started. The Microsoft Kinect video game holds Guinness World Record for the fastest-selling consumer electronics device ever. 
	The game is based on computer vision and tracks the human body in real time. Serious gamers are more inclined towards the ones with action in the real 
	world away from the device. Image recognition holds the key in generating such new user experiences and user interfaces. Combining image technologies 
	mashed up with geo-targeting and in-app purchasing, search-based commerce or advertising begin to transition into the real world, opening the doors to 
	incredible AdWords-sized, off-device business opportunities.</p>
	<p><strong>Automotive industry:</strong> Image recognition and processing is an essential part of autonomous vehicles pioneered by Google and Uber. 
	Cars of the future are expected to detect obstacles and warn you about proximity to guardrails and walkways. The technology is even capable of reading 
	road signs and stop lights. Computer vision systems powered by deep learning are trained using thousands of images. Images of road signs, humans, roads 
	etc under different weather conditions are fed into the neural networks. The systems get intelligent as more training data is fed into the system.</p>
