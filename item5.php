	<h4>Deep Learning instead of traditional rule-bases system</h4>
	<p>Fraudulent activities in finance can be detected by looking at on-surface and evident signals. Unusually, large transactions or the ones that happen 
	in atypical locations obviously deserve additional verification. Purely rule-based systems entail using algorithms that perform several fraud detection 
	scenarios. In fact, there are subtle and hidden events in user behavior that may not be evident, but still signal possible fraud. Deep Learning allows 
	for creating algorithms that process large datasets with many variables and help find these hidden correlations between user behavior and the likelihood 
	of fraudulent actions. Another strength of Deep Learning systems compared to rule-based ones is faster data processing and less manual work.</p>
